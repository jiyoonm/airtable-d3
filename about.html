                 <p> <p class = "text"> According to the FCC, Detroit, Michigan is an extremely severe digital divide. Diana Nucera is the director of the Detroit Community Technology Project. She and her team started a movement with the efforts to shut down the gap; they plan on doing so by building Internet themselves. The group began the project by focusing on underprivileged neighborhoods and installed high speed Internet that would solve the community’s digital problems. One of the major initiatives of the group is to not only provide the tools and equipment but to provide digital education. </p>

                <img src = "graphic2.png" height = "100px">
                <p> <p class = "text"> We chose to analyze and look closely at Interent Access datasets in New York City. We felt that this was a relevant topic in the current climate.  The data includes information about locations with free access to wifi, including their address, wifi provider, and wifi limitations. After analyzing the data, we decided that the best way to present the information in an effect and clean way would be to create a data visualization. </p>
                 We hope that the visualization will demonstrate a variety of trends that will provide a deeper understanding of why certain areas have lower numbers of Internet Access.

                <p> <p class = "text"> Internet Access has become such a necessity in recent years and especially now due to COVID-19. A majority of schools and workplaces have made the switch to online learning and work from home, many have even announced the permanent switch or the option to do so. What happens when one does not have access to the Internet at their household? 
                    <br> <br> We wanted to highlight the importance of ensuring that technology and Internet access becomes a staple in every household. Many jobs require digital literacy and the ability to work on a variety of platforms; without equal technology and equipment provided, many individuals will suffer in this regard.

                <h4> Internet Access vs. Inequality</h4>
                <img src = "graphic3.png"  width = "250px" height = "100px">
                <p> <p class = "text"> After analyzing the data, we found a strong correlation with areas with a higher average income having more access to free hotspot locations as well as household wifi. In areas with a lower average income, students rely on going to places such as the library to pick up Wi-fi signals. This may be the solution in “normal” times, but with the added danger of leaving the house due to COVID, how are students expected to fix this problem? This highlights the disparity between a high and low socioeconomic status in relation to technology and Internet access. Internet access at home and practice with digital learning and work will prepare a child for a stable job in the workforce where understanding of digital tools is a necessity. </p>
